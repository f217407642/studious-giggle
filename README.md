Included in this repository is the R code I used to clean up and pre-process:
1. a microarray data file 
2. a patient sample annotation file
for a group project I worked on recently.

The complete code is broken down into 3 parts.
Each part includes an aim descripion.

Use my code to help you on your coding and if you have them, offer suggestions for making my code more efficient.

Be constructive! 

Please and thank you ~
