Included in this repository is the R code I used for pre-processing files for a group project I worked on recently.

It is broken down into 3 parts.
Each part includes an aim descripion.

Use my code to help you on your coding and if you have them, offer suggestions for making my code more efficient.
Be constructive! 
Please and thank you ~
